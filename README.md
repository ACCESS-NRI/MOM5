# ACCESS-NRI Fork of Modular Ocean Model version 5 (MOM5)

This is the [ACCESS-NRI](https://www.access-nri.org.au) fork of the MOM5 Ocean Model.

The canonical MOM5 repository is here:

https://github.com/mom-ocean/MOM5

## ACCESS-NRI Fork Management

ACCESS-NRI maintains a MOM5 fork to enable and manage Continuous Integration testing and
release management for ACCESS-NRI support models. It is not envisaged that the code-base will diverge, so there is a process required to keep this fork up to date with changes in the canonical upsteam MOM5 repository.

The canonical MOM5 repository is tracked via the [upstream/master branch](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/MOM5/tree/upstream/master). 

To incorporate changes from the upstream MOM5 repository 
1. [sync the `upstream/master` branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)
1. make a pull request to `master` from `upstream/master`
1. Review and fix any conflicts and then merge the PR
